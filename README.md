# Lexery
A simple fast paced word game.

## Rules

* Add, remove, or replace a letter to form another word.
* Hit Enter to accept a word.
* Words must be in the dictionary.
* You can only use each word once.
* Words can only differ by one letter.

## Examples

Turn Grass into Salt:

      grass => glass => lass => last => salt

Find your Dinner:

      find => fine => dine => diner => dinner

## Want to help make it better?
This is a React app built with create-react-app.  
Let's make it delightful, open a PR if you have an idea.

It's all a bit sloppy at the moment, I'm sure it will become perfect with age.

The wordlist is likely the `TWL06` wordlist becuase I first built this game ages ago,
and have schlepped this wordlist around.  I am unaware of any copyright issues involved,
but if they exist I will gladly use something else.
